Current files for a project to make a 3D-printed inverted pendulum.

Obviously, the Old Versions folder contains old versions of some of the parts here.  Arm Extenders, similarly, contains pendulum arm segments to allow for an extensible lever arm.

The rest of the pieces are not descriptively named, as I just threw everything up here for convenience.  Eventually I'll put an assembly file up here which contains everything in one happy picture (you'd need to still print out the parts individually.)
